# Breast-cancer-detection

The Breast Cancer Detection project is a machine learning-based application designed to assist in the early identification of breast cancer. The project uses a dataset of medical records containing features such as cell size, texture, smoothness, and other biological measurements. By training classification algorithms (such as Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines, Random Forests, or Neural Networks), the model learns to differentiate between benign and malignant tumors.

The primary objective is to develop a reliable prediction system that can support healthcare professionals in making faster and more accurate diagnoses. The project also involves steps like data preprocessing, feature selection, model training, evaluation using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, and visualization of results. This system ultimately contributes to early detection, which is critical in improving patient outcomes and survival rates.
